            <strong>IMRa Software Terms</strong> In addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found here apply to
            any
            software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make
            available to you from time to time for your use in connection with IMRa Services (“IMRa Software”). If we
            provide specific Terms for the IMRa Software and there is a conflict between the specific Terms for
            the IMRa Software and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the IMRa Software will govern.
          </p>
          <b class="Heading2">Applicable Law</b>
          <p>
            By using any IMRa Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to
            principles
            of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise
            between you and IMRa.
          </p>
          <b class="Heading2">Disputes</b>
          <p>
            Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any IMRa Service, or any products or services sold
            or distributed by IMRa or through the IMRa Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than
            in
            court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal
            Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
          </p>

          <p> <strong>a. </strong> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award
            is limited.
            However,
            an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
            injunctive
            and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a
            court would.
          </p>
          <p> <strong>b. </strong> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration
            and describing your
            claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA
            98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules,
            including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available
            at
            www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
            be
            governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the
            arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, IMRa will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in
            arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the
            arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you
            live
            or at another mutually agreed location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c. </strong> You and IMRa each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
            only on an individual
            basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
            court
            rather than in arbitration you and IMRa each waive any right to a jury trial. You and IMRa also both agree
            that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
            rights.

          Additional IMRa Software Terms

          <div class="textFormate">
            <p>
              1. <strong>Use of the IMRa Software.</strong>You may use the IMRa Software only in connection with the
              IMRa Services. You may not separate any individual component of the IMRa Software for use other than in
              connection with the IMRa Services, incorporate any portion of it into your own programs or compile any
              portion of it in combination with your own programs, transfer it for use with another service, use it,
              or
              any portion of it, over a network, or sell, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute or sub-license the IMRa
              Software or otherwise assign any rights to the IMRa Software in whole or in part. You may not use the
              IMRa
              Software for any illegal purpose. We may discontinue some or all of any IMRa Software we provide, and we
              may terminate your right to use any IMRa Software at any time and in such event may modify it to make it
              inoperable. Your rights to use the IMRa Software will automatically terminate without notice from us if
              you fail to comply with any of these terms. Additional third party terms contained within or distributed
              with certain IMRa Software that are specifically identified in related documentation may apply to that
              IMRa Software and will govern the use of that IMRa Software in the event of a conflict with these
              Conditions of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.<strong>Use of Third Party Services.</strong>When you use the IMRa Software, you may also be using the
              services of one or more third parties, such as a wireless carrier or a mobile platform provider. Your
              use
              of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these
              third parties.
            </p>
            <p>3. <strong>No Reverse Engineering.</strong>
              You may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to modify, reverse
              engineer,
              decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with, the IMRa Software, whether in whole or in part, or
              create any derivative works from or of the IMRa Software.
            </p>
            <p>4. <strong>Updates.</strong>In order to keep the IMRa Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or
              manual updates at any time and without notice to you.</p>
            <p>5. <strong>Export Regulations; Government End Users.</strong>
              You must comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce
              and other United States agencies and authorities that may apply to the IMRa Software. If you are a U.S.
              Government end user, we are licensing the IMRa Software to you as a "Commercial Item" as that term is
              defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. § 2.101), and the rights we grant you to

        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Advertising. </strong>We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features,
          products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally
          identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please see What About Advertising?.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraud Prevention. </strong>We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in

        <strong>What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</strong>
        <p>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</p>
        <li>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</li>
        <li>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</li>
        <li>Conducting research and diagnostics to improve IMRa's content and services.</li>
        <li>Preventing fraudulent activity.</li>
        <li>Improving security.</li>
        <li>Delivering content, including ads.</li>
        <li>Reporting. This allows us to measure and analyze the performance of our services.</li>
        <p>IMRa's cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMRa's essential features. For instance, if you block
          or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to contribute content, review films, add items to your
          Watchlist, or use any IMRa Services that require you to sign in.</p>
        <p>Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with IMRa Services. Third parties include
          providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks, ad networks, ad serving companies,
          and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads
          relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of
          IMRa. They may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. </p>
        <p>You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell
          you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
          receive a new cookie, how to block cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you block all cookies on your
          browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you
          may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may
          not work.</p>
        <strong>Does IMRa Share Your Personal Information?</strong>
        <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling
          our users' personal information to others. We share user information with our parent corporation
          (Amazon.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it controls that follow practices at least as protective as those
          described in this Privacy Notice, and as described below.</p>

        <li><strong>Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong> We make available to you services provided by third
          parties. For example, you can purchase movie tickets from third parties through Showtimes & Tickets. You can
          tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share users' personal information related
          to those transactions with that third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform
          functions on our behalf. Examples include processing payments, removing repetitive information from user
          lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and transmitting content. They have access to
          personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other
          businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business
          assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
          user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that IMRa.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets
          are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li>
        <li><strong>Protection of IMRa and Others:</strong>We release account and other personal information when we
          believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
          agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMRa, our users, or others. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
          reduction.</li>
        <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared
          with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

        <strong>What About Advertising?</strong>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites:</strong> IMRa Services may include
          third-party advertising and
          links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when
          you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
          advertising at IMRa, including interest-based ads, please read the Amazon Interest-Based Ads policy. To
          adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page. </li>
        <p><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong> We provide ad-serving companies, ad networks and
          advertising companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads and
          to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you
          when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For
          example, we may share a cookie or advertising identifier together with a request to deliver an advertisement
          with an ad network to enable you to receive more relevant ads. As an additional example, if you have already
          downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you
          will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
          relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising
          (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page. <strong>How
            Secure Is
            Information About Me?</strong></p>
        <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p>

        <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers,
