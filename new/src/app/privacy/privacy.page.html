        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Advertising. </strong>We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features,
          products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally
          identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please see What About Advertising?.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraud Prevention. </strong>We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in
          order to protect the security of our customers, IMRa, and others.
        </li>
        <strong>What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</strong>
        <p>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</p>
        <li>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</li>
        <li>We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively "cookies") to recognize your browser or
          device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for
          additional purposes, including:</li>
        <li>Conducting research and diagnostics to improve IMRa's content and services.</li>
        <li>Preventing fraudulent activity.</li>
        <li>Improving security.</li>
        <li>Delivering content, including ads.</li>
        <li>Reporting. This allows us to measure and analyze the performance of our services.</li>
        <p>IMRa's cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMRa's essential features. For instance, if you block
          or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to contribute content, review films, add items to your
          Watchlist, or use any IMRa Services that require you to sign in.</p>
        <p>Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with IMRa Services. Third parties include
          providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks, ad networks, ad serving companies,
          and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads
          relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of
          IMRa. They may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. </p>
        <p>You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell
          you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
          receive a new cookie, how to block cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you block all cookies on your
          browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you
          may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may
          not work.</p>
        <strong>Does IMRa Share Your Personal Information?</strong>
        <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling
          our users' personal information to others. We share user information with our parent corporation
          (Amazon.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it controls that follow practices at least as protective as those
          described in this Privacy Notice, and as described below.</p>

        <li><strong>Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong> We make available to you services provided by third
          parties. For example, you can purchase movie tickets from third parties through Showtimes & Tickets. You can
          tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share users' personal information related
          to those transactions with that third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform
          functions on our behalf. Examples include processing payments, removing repetitive information from user
          lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and transmitting content. They have access to
          personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other
          businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business
          assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
          user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that IMRa.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets
          are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li>
        <li><strong>Protection of IMRa and Others:</strong>We release account and other personal information when we
          believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
          agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMRa, our users, or others. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
          reduction.</li>
        <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared
          with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

        <strong>What About Advertising?</strong>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites:</strong> IMRa Services may include
          third-party advertising and
          links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when
          you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
          advertising at IMRa, including interest-based ads, please read the Amazon Interest-Based Ads policy. To
          adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page. </li>
        <p><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong> We provide ad-serving companies, ad networks and
          advertising companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads and
          to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you
          when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For
          example, we may share a cookie or advertising identifier together with a request to deliver an advertisement
          with an ad network to enable you to receive more relevant ads. As an additional example, if you have already
          downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you
          will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
          relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising
          (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the Your Ads Privacy Choices page. <strong>How
            Secure Is
            Information About Me?</strong></p>
        <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p>

        <li>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with collection, storage, and
          disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request

        <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers,
          devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your IMRa account that is not used for
